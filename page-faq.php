	 	<div class="inset-text"><p>First, to everyone who pre-ordered the product - your commitment and support matters immensely to us.  We appreciate your patience and assure you will deliver a great product that is unlike any other wireless audio product in existence today.</p>
		<p>At this stage we expect the mini to be in production in about 10 weeks.  Yes, we are running late – guilty as charged. But we want to get everything 100% right before shipping. Too many companies ship half-baked products to meet deadlines. We are not one of them – never will be. While deadlines are important to us, and we will absolutely do our best to meet them, quality comes first every time.</p></div>
