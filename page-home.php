			<p>"This is an IMPRESSIVE speaker that involves a lot of sophisticated engineering, high-performance parts and meticulous attention to detail. Sonically, this speaker was thrilling. It renders a far greater soundstage with depth, height and musicality than any speaker this size or price has any right to.... I couldn't believe what I was hearing and where it was coming from."</p>

		  <h2>Designed on Earth &mdash; Assembled in Denmark</h2>
		  <div class="col">
			<p>Much of today&#39;s loudspeaker theory and design methodology was developed in Australia. Research conducted at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Sydney University by legendary audio engineers such as N. Thiele, R. Small and others laid the foundation for modern loudspeaker design practice.</p>
			<p>The Mini Aero&rsquo;s mechanical and acoustic design was done in Sydney by a team with a world-class audio heritage and decades of acoustic engineering experience, including design of bespoke monitoring loudspeakers for recording studios such as EMI Studio 301, Benchmark Studios and consultancy for various high-end British and US brands.</p>	
		  </div>
		  <div class="col">
			<p>To complete the design of the Mini Aero, we partnered with the world leading specialists in transducer design and manufacturing, analog and digital electronics design, signal processing, and amplification. Scan-Speak, Danville Signal, Hypex, and DSP Concepts are world leaders in their fields. We are thankful to all of them for the contributions they made.</p>
			<p>The Mini Aero is assembled in Denmark by Scan-Speak A/S. The legendary attention to detail and manufacturing expertise is applied to every single Mini Aero, in the same way as it applies to every single drive unit produced by Scan-Speak. All Scan-Speak drive units are designed and made in Denmark at the company&#39;s facility in Videb&aelig;k.</p>
