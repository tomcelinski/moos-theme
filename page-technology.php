        <h2>Wireless audio done right.</h2>
		  <p>Wireless transmission for critical audio applications has been an elusive dream. Until now.</p>
        <p>The WATT&trade; Wireless Audio Transport Technology is the first to achieve reliable transmission of 100% lossless, bit-accurate, high-resolution digital audio content at up to and including 24bit/96kHz. The system supports playback of 24bit/192kHz content via ultra high performance asynchronous sample rate converters. And while others may claim 24bit/96kHz wireless playback, WATT&trade; is the only system that achieves this without affecting the bit stream as a way of mitigating wireless interference. Nothing comes close.</p>

        <h2>Quad differential DACs: SNR > 125dB</h2>
        <p>Each Mini Aero speaker pair utilizes four independent ultra high performance Wolfson Digital to Analog Converters (DACs), with an independent DAC feeding each tweeter and woofer. The advantage is no cross-talk, and the ability to run each DAC in mono differential mode, giving a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of over 125dB. And with a choice of advanced filter characteristics, including linear and minimum phase, the DACs deliver and extraordinarily detailed yet natural and silky-smooth analogue rendition.</p>
		  <p>Naturally, careful attention has been paid to the design of power supplies and analogue filtering that accompanies the DACs, including the use of LME49720 ultra-low distortion, low noise, high slew rate audio operational amplifiers.  It all adds up to sensational sound.</p>        <div class="clear"></div>

      <h2>Ultra low jitter design.</h2>
		<p>The performance of DACs depends on variations in the clocking of digital data samples, known as jitter. Jitter is a source of distortion, leading to noticeable loss of musical detail and refinement.</p>
		<p>The design of the Mini Aero goes to exceptional lengths to eliminate jitter. The WATT&trade; wireless transport has inherently low jitter. But to ensure ultimate performance, the digital signal chain contains two Analog Devices Asynchronous Sample Rate Converters (ASRCs), one on the wireless transmitter and one in each speaker. This is combined with an ultra low jitter master clock, and careful design of clock distribution circuitry. The end result is vanishingly low jitter and incredible resolution of musical detail.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>All-aluminium unibody port with symmetrical dual flares.</h2>
		  <p>The port, or vent, extends the low frequency range beyond that of an equivalent sealed speaker. A well designed vented enclosure achieves bass extension while minimizing audible artifacts due to turbulent air movement.</p>
		  <p>The ideal port is extremely smooth and rigid, has a sufficiently large diameter, is mounted very securely within the enclosure and has smooth flares on both ends, with flare diameter at least a quarter of the port diameter. Very few speaker ports meet these requirements for cost reasons.</p>
		  <p>The port on the Mini Aero is a unique all-aluminium design. The 40mm smooth inner section and symmetric dual flares achieve exceptionally low turbulence and excellent air flow characteristics. The outer flare is machined into the 10mm speaker back panel. The port tube is fused to the back plane using aerospace-grade adhesive, in a seam-free and fastener-free unibody arrangement, achieving exceptional rigidity and freedom from unwanted resonances.</p>

        <h2>Aluminium-reinforced birch plywood cabinet.</h2>
        <p>The cabinet enclosures of the Mini are crafted from highest grade Baltic birch plywood. Renowned for its acoustic qualities, this material is used in many flagship speakers. The plywood is carefully reinforced with aluminium to maximize stiffness.</p>
		  <p>The Mini&#39;s cabinet features a 21mm front baffle and extensive internal bracing for maximum stiffness. The bracing, in combination with the aluminium reinforcement, achieves excellent rigidity and drastically reduces unwanted wall panel resonances. This results in a cabinet with an extremely low noise signature and gives the Mini Aero the ability to present a truly astonishing level of musical detail.</p>

<section id="damping" class="light clear">
    <div class="wrapper">
        <h2>Composite acoustic damping - sheep meet NASA.</h2>
        <p>An ideal loudspeaker has no acoustic output from the cabinet walls. This is extremely difficult to achieve as the movement of drive units generates substantial mechanical excitation of the walls and internal acoustic excitation due to air pressure changes and standing waves. The solution is to use a damping material, but traditional materials have limited effect.</p>
		  <p>The acoustic damping used in the Mini Aero is unlike any other. Finest quality long-fibre natural Merino&reg; wool is specifically processed to reduce fibre diameter to sub 10 micron, maximizing conversion of kinetic energy into heat as air passes through. This is complemented by an extraordinary acoustic foam originally developed to protect astronauts from extreme noise during NASA space shuttle missions. The end result is acoustic output free of colorations, with superb sonic clarity and exceptional precision in rendering of the sound stage.</p>

        <h2>Hypex amplification - class D reimagined.</h2>
		  <p>Once the poor cousins of class A and class AB analog amplifiers, class-D (switching) amplifiers have recently seen tremendous advances in technology and performance. Today the very best class-D amplifiers, made by Hypex of the Netherlands, not only match but actually outperform analog amplifiers in both measured performance and listening tests.</p>
		  <p>The amplifiers used in the Mini Aero are the latest generation, and the pinnacle of the celebrated Hypex UcD range. They deliver up to 100W continuous power per drive unit (200W per speaker) at total harmonic distortion levels of less than 0.01%, and less than 0.003% at power levels below 50W, where most music listening takes place. This translates to combined system power output of 200W, at distortion levels of 0.003%, and 400W at distortion levels of 0.01% - exemplary figures by any standard.&nbsp;</p>  
		  <p>A matched power supply peaks at 550W <em>per speaker</em>, giving total instantaneous system power capability of over 1kW. And since the Mini Aero are an active design, the amplifiers feed the speaker drive units directly, with none of the problems associated with driving passive crossover networks. It all adds up to extremely tight and authoritative bass, extraordinary dynamics, and spectacular clarity through the mid range and top end.</p>

        <h2>Enter the SHARC – killer DSP.</h2>
        <p>Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is at the heart of the Mini Aero, responsible for the separation of high and low frequency components (digital crossover) as well as frequency response correction, and time alignment of drive units.</p>
		  <p>The computationally intensive DSP functionality is handled by a high performance Analog Devices SHARC floating point signal processor, with 32-bit processing word size and 64-bit accumulator. The use of this high performance floating point ensures that residual effects of calculations are vanishingly small. The SHARC processors also provide hardware-based, ultra low distortion sample rate conversion functionality used in jitter reduction.</p>
		  <p>Each speaker contains a dedicated SHARC DSP. In addition, a SHARC DSP is also used in the wireless transmitter to support the proprietary pre-processing used to ensure high integrity, 100% bit-accurate wireless transmission at data rates of 24bit/96kHz. Like everything else in the Mini Aero, the DSP processing is second to none &ndash; ultimate DSP for ultimate speakers.</p>
