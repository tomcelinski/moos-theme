		<h2>The Moos Story.</h2>
		<p>We are a group of engineers and audio geeks on a quest for perfect music reproduction. We want music to sound as good at home as it does in the recording studio or live venue. We are not the compromising types. As engineers, we are obsessed with designing the most awesome audio products, and we don’t cut corners to save cost – yep, really, we just don’t do that, period. We are 100% independently owned, so can do as we please an that means doing everything right when it comes to giving you the best sound you will ever hear.</p>
		<p>We are based in Australia where we do all of the acoustic design and R&D work in-house. We also have presence in the USA in order to support our North American customers. We are looking to establish European presence in the next 12 months.</p>

		<h3>Tom – Head Moos</h3>
		<p>Tom established Moos as an excuse to spend tons of money to develop the audio system of his dreams. In past lives Tom used to be the Head of Embedded Systems at Linn in the UK, where he learned all about high-end Hi-Fi systems that sound truly awesome, and developed an addition to insanely great sound. Tom subsequently co-founded a company that was the first in the world to achieve lossless, synchronous stereo and multi-channel audio playback over WiFi. Tom is certifiably obsessive with detail and doing things right when it comes to design. He has a PhD in Systems Engineering and has co-authored or contributed to over a dozen patents related to networked and wireless audio.</p>

		<h3>Brad – Head of Acoustics</h3>
		<p>Brad has been designing loudspeakers for longer than he or anybody can remember. Rumour has it he designed his first loudspeaker when he was still in nappies (aka diapers), though controversy rages over the feasibility of this. Brad has previously founded Orpheus Loudspeakers, a leading high-end Australian loudspeaker brand, and has acted as acoustic design consultant for several high profile Australian, UK and US loudspeaker brands, which are to remain unnamed for legal reasons. His has also designed studio monitors for several respected recording studios, including EMI Studio 301 and Benchmark Studios, as well as various professional broadcast facilities.</p>

		<h3>Rupert – Head of Awesomeness</h3>
		<p>Rupert is the Leonardo DaVinci of Moos – a keen student of physics and philosophy, and fine artist at heart. A true renaissance man, Rupert has a rare talent for turning highly technical information into something that looks insanely great. Whether it’s product photography, graphic design or web development, Rupert is the man who makes it happen and does so totally effortlessly. He also happens to be an accomplished musician who shares the Moos obsession with insanely awesome sound.</p>
